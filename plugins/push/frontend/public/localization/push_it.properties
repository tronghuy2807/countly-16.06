# Help
help.manage-apps.push-apn-certificate = Certificate file for Apple Push Notification (APN) service. In order to send Push Notifications, you need to supply at least one .PK12 file for this app.
help.manage-apps.push-apn-id = App Store ID for your app. It's required only if you're going to send Update or Review messages.
help.manage-apps.push-gcm-key = Server API Key for Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) service. It's required if you're going to send messages to your Android app users from Countly. You can get one from Google API Console.
help.manage-apps.push-gcm-id = Google Project ID that you can get from Google API Console.
help.manage-apps.push-apn-certificate-old = Old certificates (made prior to beginning of 2016) are the ones which are made either for development environment, or production. In 2016 Apple introduced new universal certificates which work in both environments. While you can continue using old certificates until they expire, any upload of universal certificate will remove old ones.

Action for a plain text message is just the fact of receiving it, while action for URL, Update or Review message types is pressing a positive button and subsequently going to URL or App Store.
help.dashboard.push.enabling-rate = Messaging enabling conversion rate. That is total percentage of users who enabled APN or GCM in your app and allowed sending messages to them.
help.dashboard.push.delivery-rate = A number of messages delivered divided by a number of messages sent.
help.dashboard.push.actions-rate = A number of actions performed divided by a number of messages sent.
help.dashboard.messaging-users = A number of users who agreed to recieve push notifications, that is a number of users with APN or GCM tokens stored in Countly database.
